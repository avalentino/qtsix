About
=====

*QtSix* provides a compatibility layer that allows to write Python
applications that work with different Qt_ bindings: PyQt5_, PyQt4_ or
PySide_.

An application that used *QtSix* can work correctly if **any** of the
supported Qt_ bindings is installed on the system.
*QtSix* automatically detects available bindings and uses them
transparently.

If more than one Qt_ binding is present on the system then it is selected
the first one available in the following order: PyQt5_, PyQt4_, PySide_.

Of course *QtSix* supports both `Python 2`_ and `Python 3`_.


The API
=======

The reference API and the reference package layout used by *QtSix* is
the one provided by PyQt5_.

An application written for PyQt5_ is expected to work correctly if
all imports form PyQt5_ are replaced with imports from *QtSix*.

Applications written for PyQt4_ or PySide_ should be ported to the PyQt5_
API in order to be able to use *QtSix*.

Since *QtSix* is meant to be a compatibility layer it only provides
PyQt5_ features that are also present in at least one of the other Qt_
bindings.


Installation
============

*QtSix* can be installed using pip_::

    $ pip install qtsix

or using the `setup.py` script included in the package::

    $ python setup.py install

.. note::

    The desired Qt_ bindings should be installed separately.
    The installation of *QtSix* does not automatically trigger the
    installation of any of the supported Qt_ bindings.
